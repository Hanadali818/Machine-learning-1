README: Iris Flower Classification
This repository contains code for a simple machine learning model that classifies iris flowers into different species using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. The dataset used for training and testing the model is the popular Iris dataset.

Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook
Scikit-learn
Joblib

Instructions
Clone this repository to your local machine:
git clone <repository-url>
Navigate to the directory containing the Jupyter Notebook file.

Open the Jupyter Notebook file (iris_classification.ipynb) using Jupyter Notebook.

Run the code cells in the notebook sequentially.

About the Code
Loading the Dataset
The Iris dataset is loaded using Scikit-learn's load_iris function. It consists of feature data (X) and target labels (y).

Splitting the Data
The dataset is split into training and testing sets using Scikit-learn's train_test_split function.

Model Training
A K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier is trained on the training data with n_neighbors=4.

Model Evaluation
The accuracy of the model is evaluated using the testing data.

Making Predictions
Predictions are made on sample data and the predicted species are printed.

Saving and Loading the Model
The trained model is serialized using Joblib's dump function and saved as mlbrain.joblib. It is then loaded back into memory using the load function for making predictions on new data.
